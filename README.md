```

## Usage

```
‚ûú tinyjam -h

    Jam to tiny desks with tinyjam v0.1.2!
        -l,--list       path to a file where every line is the name of an artist 
                        who appeared on tiny desk. if they did multiple shows
                        adding the year they performed can specify this.
        -o,--output     path to an output directory to download video files to,
                        default is './jamsesh'
        -n,--nodownload do not download video files, instead stream directly 
                        from youtube
        -f,--force      if output directory exists + contains same # of elements as
                        the number of lines in list then nuke contents and
                        download videos again. default behavior is to assume all
                        files are already downloaded and play them
        -c,--color      flag to display videos in color
        -h,--help       display this help message
